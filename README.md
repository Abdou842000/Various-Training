# Various Training 🚀

Welcome to the **Various Training** repository! This is my personal playground where I experiment with different datasets, review fundamental concepts, and explore new techniques while enjoying the process of learning.

---

## 🧩 **Goal**
The primary objective of this repository is to:
- **Revise Basics**: Brush up on core skills and essential concepts in data science and machine learning.
- **Explore Techniques**: Try out innovative approaches, new libraries, and frameworks.
- **Learn by Doing**: Expand my knowledge base by experimenting with diverse datasets.
- **Have Fun!**: Keep the learning process engaging and enjoyable.

## 📁 **Repository Structure**
Currently, I’m just getting started! Here's what’s inside so far:
- **`Titanic`**: My first project where I play around with the Titanic dataset. This includes basic preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and experimenting with simple machine learning models.
- **`.gitignore`**: Configured to exclude unnecessary files from being tracked.
- **`README.md`**: This document providing insights into the repository's purpose and structure.

## ✨ **What’s Coming?**
While the repository currently focuses on basics with the Titanic dataset, more projects and datasets will be added soon! Stay tuned for:
1. More advanced preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
2. Projects in diverse domains like NLP, computer vision, and time series.
3. Exploration of new machine learning and deep learning frameworks.
